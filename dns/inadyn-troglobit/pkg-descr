Inadyn is a small and simple Dynamic DNS, DDNS, client with HTTPS support.

Commonly available in many GNU/Linux distributions, used in off the shelf
routers and Internet gateways to automate the task of keeping your Internet
name in sync with your public IP address. It can also be used in installations
with redundant (backup) connections to the Internet.
