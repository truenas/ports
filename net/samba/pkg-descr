Samba is the standard Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and Unix.

Since 1992, Samba has provided secure, stable and fast file and print services for
all clients using the SMB/CIFS protocol, such as all versions of DOS and Windows, OS/2,
Linux and many others.

Samba is an important component to seamlessly integrate Linux/Unix Servers and
Desktops into Active Directory environments. It can function both as a domain controller
or as a regular domain member.
