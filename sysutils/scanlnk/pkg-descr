scanlnk scans for symlinks that point to the device underlying "/".

Very basic smoke-test for whether a file is a symlink back to
the freenas boot device. A "quick" scan (-a quick) will exit on
first symlink back to the device underlying /. A full scan will
print a full list of problematic symlinks on stderr. Program returns
0 if no problems detected or ELOOP if a problem is detected.
