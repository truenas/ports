winacl provides a variety of functionality for working with NFSv4 ACLs

Primary use is to synthensize inherited ACLs given a path, and then
apply the ACLs intelligently across all files and subdirectories.
This tool also contains actions to strip ACLs, chown files (without
impacting existing ACL), restore ACLs from backups, and deduplicate
ACL entries (recursively).
